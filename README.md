## Discord 8MB MP4 Compressor
A tool that can compress any MP4 file to 8MB for Discord's 8MB file-sharing cap (unless you have Nitro).

## How It Works
Compresses MP4's using ffmpeg and ffprobe calcuations.

## Prerequisites
### Windows: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows

Extract `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` to the same directory as `Discord8MbMp4Compressor.exe`.

### Linux: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-linux

Install `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` through your package manager.

## Issues:

### `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`

You may need to install `python3`, `tkinter` and `psutil` and run `RunDiscord8MbMp4Compressor.py` instead.

### Usage
Windows: Run `Discord8MbMp4Compressor_win.exe`

Linux: Run `Discord8MbMp4Compressor_linux`

Just Python: Run `Discord8MbMp4Compressor.py`
